# Supermarket_Data-Analysis

This repository contains the code and analysis for two supervised learning tasks:
1. High-Performing Supermarkets Prediction: Predicting future revenue trends to classify supermarkets as high-performing.
2. Voucher Uplift Analysis: Identifying which item types benefit most from voucher usage to maximize incremental sales.

The analysis leverages transactional data (Sales.csv), product attributes (Items.csv), and store locations (Supermarkets.csv). The project involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training using Random Forest Regressor.
